# Recipe Randomizer
This program stores recipes and allows the user to see the ingredients of dishes, add/delete dishes, and randomize dishes to create a meal.
## Motivation
I was inspired to make this program by my mom, who has a large cook book containing all the dishes she makes for dinner. Since she has trouble deciding what to dishes to make for dinner everyday, I wanted to make a program that can help her by outputting a random combination of dishes. Creating this project was also way for me to practice programming in C++. In this specific project, I worked a lot with strings and text file reading/writing.
## Features
- Adding and removing dishes
- Search for specific dishes
- View all ingredients of a dish
- View all dishes of a certain category (meat, vegetable, or soup)
